# Assignment - Build / Session URLs

After running tests on BrowserStack, capture the session/build URL and paste into your assignment sheet.

Example placeholders:
- BROWSERSTACK_SESSION_URL: https://automate.browserstack.com/sessions/<session-id>
- PERCY_PROJECT_URL: (link from Percy dashboard showing snapshot run)

The test prints a BrowserStack session JSON URL to stdout like:
=== BROWSERSTACK_SESSION_URL_PLACEHOLDER ===
https://automate.browserstack.com/sessions/<session-id>.json
=== END_BS_URL ===

Copy the session URL (remove .json if you prefer the web UI link) into your assignment sheet.
